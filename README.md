# aipatch

`aipatch` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the "Context Gathering -> LLM Prompting -> Code Application" loop. It formats codebases for LLMs and applies the structured responses back to your files.

## Installation

```bash
# Standard pip
pip install --upgrade aipatch

# pipx (Recommended)
pipx install aipatch

# uv
uvx aipatch --help
```

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context (The Prompt)

The goal is to generate a single text block containing the "Rules" (prelude) and the "Code" (clip) to paste into your LLM.

#### Basic: Single Project
Combine the system instructions with all Python files in the current directory.

```bash
# Get the standard prompt rules
RULE="$(aipatch prelude)"

# Get file contents (using ripgrep to list files)
CODE="$(rg --files -g '!venv' | rg '\.py$' | aipatch clip --stdout --project my_app)"

# Copy to clipboard
printf "%s\n\n%s\n" "$RULE" "$CODE" | pbcopy
```

#### Advanced: Multi-Project Context
When you need to modify an API and a Frontend simultaneously, you can capture context from different directories and assign them distinct project IDs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Get the Rules
RULE="$(aipatch prelude)"

# 2. Get Backend Code
cd ~/projects/backend-api
GO_CODE="$(rg --files | rg '\.go$' | aipatch clip --stdout --project backend)"
# Add specific documentation
GO_CODE="$GO_CODE$(echo 'docs/api-spec.md' | aipatch clip --stdout --project backend)"

# 3. Get Frontend Code
cd ~/projects/mobile-app
# Get Kotlin code and the Manifest
KOTLIN_CODE="$(rg --files | rg '\.kt$' | aipatch clip --stdout --project android)"
MANIFEST="$(echo 'app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml' | aipatch clip --stdout --project android)"

# 4. Combine and Copy
printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n" "$RULE" "$GO_CODE" "$KOTLIN_CODE" "$MANIFEST" | pbcopy

echo "Copied context for Backend and Android to clipboard."
```

#### Expert: Git Branch Comparison (Time Travel)
Useful when asking an LLM to analyze changes between a refactor and the original code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

RULE="$(aipatch prelude)"

# 1. Capture the OLD state
git switch legacy-branch
OLD_CODE="$(rg --files | rg '\.kt$' | aipatch clip --stdout --project legacy)"

# 2. Capture the NEW state
git switch main
NEW_CODE="$(rg --files | rg '\.kt$' | aipatch clip --stdout --project refactor)"

# 3. Combine
printf "%s\n\n# --- OLD VERSION ---\n%s\n\n# --- NEW VERSION ---\n%s\n" "$RULE" "$OLD_CODE" "$NEW_CODE" | pbcopy
```

### 2. Apply Changes (The Patch)

Once the LLM generates a response containing `*SEARCH/REPLACE*` blocks, copy that response to your clipboard.

#### Basic Apply
Reads the LLM response from the clipboard and applies it.

```bash
aipatch pbpaste | aipatch patch
```

#### Apply with Git Commit
Automatically stages changed files and commits them using the summary generated by the LLM.

```bash
aipatch pbpaste | aipatch patch --git-commit
```

#### Apply to Specific Project Only
If your prompt included multiple projects (e.g., `backend` and `android`), but the LLM provided one big response, you can choose to apply only the `android` changes first.

```bash
aipatch pbpaste | aipatch patch --git-commit --project android
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aipatch prelude` | Outputs the standard system prompt/rules for the LLM. |
| `aipatch clip` | Reads filenames from stdin and formats their content. Use `--stdout` to pipe results. |
| `aipatch patch` | Reads LLM response from stdin and applies edits. |
| `aipatch pbcopy` | Utility to copy stdin to system clipboard. |
| `aipatch pbpaste` | Utility to print system clipboard to stdout. |

### Common Flags
*   `--project <name>`: Tags the code block with a project ID (e.g., `backend`, `ios`). Essential for multi-repo edits.
*   `--git-commit`: (For `patch`) Stages changes and commits with the LLM's summary.
